 It was a game I developed a long time ago


# CUBE
At the time of release, I decided to give up trying to solve too much difficulty Gradius 3.
I'm completely addicted to what I thought now.
As soon as the cube 99 fire is released, super gamers are doing it
I knew that when I came up to 99 barrages with my own hands
I can't forget the excitement.

Crystal solidified beauty, expressionless inorganic matter (probably)
I was intoxicated by the infinite fear of coming, and after enlightenment, I said "MB2"
While speaking in English, I once again diverted to a side street,
If you can taste it, "said Simulator (rather than environmental software)
Was made.(I didn't shoot a shot this time, sorry)

Fortunately my friend can go to the second side of the second lap and have more base
There was a person who was dripping in Gradius 3
So, every time we upgrade, we ask you to play as much as possible
I intend to make something close to Cade, but ...
If I had more data, I think it would be a little better
But this time, I had to make it in a limited time, so
I raised it around here.

When the crystals overlap, the sound effects are initially as usual in PCM
I was thinking about it, but noise was inevitable
It didn't sound good, so I asked SENDO to make it with FM sound source
I got it. I don't expect to do this with ear copy
was. (That's why there is no BGM. If you have a CD
Will play with 9 pieces of Crystal Labyrinth
I think the atmosphere will come out even more)

Hira-kun made the screen deletion when clearing.
I think, "I think he's free, I don't know ..." (like a sound theater)
When I was there, Hira who was near me became a victimWas. Gassho.
